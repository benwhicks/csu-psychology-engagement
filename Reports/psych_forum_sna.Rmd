Exploring comparisons between the forum networks of Biopsychology and Social Psychology run in 2017 and 2018, using techniques common to Social Network Analysis (SNA) for education[^1]. Of particular interest is examining triadic closure and strong / weak ties in the network. 

# Understanding the results

In the tabular results for each forum network below, there are a few concepts worth outlining.

## Overall structure and definitions

**Nodes** : The nodes (or vertices) in the network are the people involved in the forum. The total number (recorded as _nodes_ below) is just the number of students enrolled plus any academics that participated in the forum. Students in the course that did not post in the forum are included.

**Edges** : The edges in the network represent 'interactions' between students on the forum. So if Student A replies to a forum post of Student B, then this is represented by connecting those two students with an edge (line). These edges are directed; Student A replying to a post of Student B connects $A \rightarrow B$. Note that an edge in this context is a collection of forum posts (and the associated text data) between two people.

**Density** : How 'full' the network is, calculated as the ratio of edges in the graph to the total number of possible edges.

**Average Path Length** : A _path_ in this context is a series of forum-connected students, and this is the average length of this paths. It is sometimes called the _degree of separation_ or the _characteristic path length_, and along with centralisation is a key measure in graph-level summary statistics[^2].

**Transitivity** : Sometimes called the _clustering coefficient_ this measures the probability that adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected. In the context of the forum; if Student A has interacted directly on the forum with Student B *and* Student C this is the probability that Student B and Student C.

**Edge betweenness** : A measure of the 'strength' of an edge, by finding approximately how many shortest paths pass through that particular edge.  

**Centralisation** : As calculated here this uses the *betweenness* metric defined above, and aggregates the betweenness

## Triads

Studying each subset of possible 3-node subgraphs in the network has been shown to be effective in analysing affiliation networks[^5][^3]. 

### Mutual-Asymmetric-Null Triadic Classes

The Mutual-Asymmetric-Null encoding system classifies triad connections in a _directed graph_. The three numbers represent, in order, the number of (M)utual edges, the number of (A)symmetric edges, and the number of (N)ull or no edges between nodes. The possible connections (and their names) are outlined below:

![](images/triad_census_types.png)

### Triad Census

The _Triad Census_ classifies all 3-node subsets according to the Mutual-Asymmetric-Null class above, and is compared to the expected number of those triads for a random graph of the same number of nodes and density. 

## Expected values

All these measures are useful, but hard to know what to compare them to. One way around this is to compare them to random graphs with similar properties[^2][^4]. So for each analysed network `r TRIALS` random graphs were generated using the same number of nodes and density. The random graphs are generated using the _Erdos-Renyi_ method[^6], and then the results averaged to generate an approximate expected value of each given metric.

## Remarks

### Consistent patterns in the Triadic Census

There are some regular patterns in all the forum networks that deviate significantly from the expected values. To understand what is going on it is best to look at the triads in similar groups comparing Mutual edges with Asymmetric edges. The first such group is comparing triad _012_ with triad _102_, where the former contains a single Asymmetric edge (a reply from one student to another, with a third student not connected) and the latter a Mutual edge (the reply is reciprocated at some point - not necassarily in the same forum thread). All graphs demonstrate the Asymmetric edge is much less likely than expected, and the Mutual edge much more abundant than expected.

This trend continues if we look at triads with a single path like structure; _021C_, _021D_ and _021U_ containing more Asymmetric edges compared with _111D_, _111U_ and _201_ containing more mutual edges. This effect is not as consistent across all four forums, for instance Biopsychology in 2017 had greater than expected numbers of the _021U_ triad, but overall there is a trend of Mutual connections (edges) being favoured over Asymmetric ones. In the context of the forum, if Student A replies to a post of Student B it is highly likely that later in the course Student B will reply to Student A, forming a reciprocal relationship.

### Triadic Census changes from 2017 to 2018

The closed triads where not as consistent across the four forums, but did show some change from 2017 to 2018,and differences between the two subjects. Note that the *expected* number of triads for each of this closed triads was close to 0 for the complete graph, and only reached around 5 for some of the *120_* triads in some of the networks.

``` {r triad_progression}
df <- tibble(`MAN class` = c("120D", "120U", "120C", "210", "300"),
             `SocPsy 2017` = analyse_graph(forumGraphSoc17)$`Triad Census`$Triads[12:16],
             `SocPsy 2018` = analyse_graph(forumGraphSoc18)$`Triad Census`$Triads[12:16],
             `BioPsy 2017` = analyse_graph(forumGraphBio17)$`Triad Census`$Triads[12:16],
             `BioPsy 2018` = analyse_graph(forumGraphBio18)$`Triad Census`$Triads[12:16]
             )
flextable(df) %>% colformat_num(col_keys = c("SocPsy 2017", "SocPsy 2018", "BioPsy 2017", "BioPsy 2018"),
                                digits = 0)
```

Looking at Biopsychology, although there was a drop in overall closed triads, the balance of these closed triads shifted to the more egalitarian networks away from the more hierarchical - the triads with _D_ or _U_ tend to favour a hierarchical network where as _120C_, _210_ and _300_ are more representative or egalitarian networks[^7]. Social Psychology saw a broad strengthening in the number of these closed triads forming. 

``` {r edge_strength}
# Need to add stuff using edge.betweenness function for finding strong paths,

# then look at using the tidytext package for sentiment analysis, etc
```
