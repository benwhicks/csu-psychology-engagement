Exploring comparisons between the forum networks of Biopsychology and Social Psychology run in 2017 and 2018, using techniques common to Social Network Analysis (SNA) for education[^1]. Of particular interest is examining triadic closure and strong / weak ties in the network. 

# Understanding the results

In the tabular results for each forum network below, there are a few concepts worth outlining.

## Overall structure and definitions

**Nodes** : The nodes (or vertices) in the network are the people involved in the forum. The total number (recorded as _nodes_ below) is just the number of students enrolled plus any academics that participated in the forum. Students in the course that did not post in the forum are included.

**Edges** : The edges in the network represent 'interactions' between students on the forum. So if Student A replies to a forum post of Student B, then this is represented by connecting those two students with an edge (line). These edges are directed; Student A replying to a post of Student B connects $A \rightarrow B$. Note that an edge in this context is a collection of forum posts (and the associated text data) between two people.

**Density** : How 'full' the network is, calculated as the ratio of edges in the graph to the total number of possible edges.

**Average Path Length** : A _path_ in this context is a series of forum-connected students, and this is the average length of this paths. It is sometimes called the _degree of separation_ or the _characteristic path length_, and along with centralisation is a key measure in graph-level summary statistics[^2].

**Transitivity** : Sometimes called the _clustering coefficient_ this measures the probability that adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected. In the context of the forum; if Student A has interacted directly on the forum with Student B *and* Student C this is the probability that Student B and Student C.

**Edge betweenness** : A measure of the 'strength' of an edge, by finding approximately how many shortest paths pass through that particular edge.  

**Centralisation** : As calculated here this uses the *betweenness* metric defined above, and aggregates the betweenness

## Triads

Studying each subset of possible 3-node subgraphs in the network has been shown to be effective in analysing affiliation networks[^5][^3]. In a _directed graph_ the possible connections (and their names) are outlined below:

### Mutual-Asymmetric-Null Triadic Classes

![](images/triad_census.jpg)

### Triad Census

The _Triad Census_ classifies all 3-node subsets according to the Mutual-Asymmetric-Null class above, and is compared to the expected number of those triads for a random graph of the same number of nodes and density. 

## Expected values

All these measures are useful, but hard to know what to compare them to. One way around this is to compare them to random graphs with similar properties[^2][^4]. So for each analysed network `r TRIALS` random graphs were generated using the same number of nodes and density. The random graphs are generated using the _Erdos-Renyi_ method[^6], and then the results averaged to generate an approximate expected value of each given metric.
